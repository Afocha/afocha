# AVM
Aggregated Virtualization Manager

## Introduction
`Aggregated Virtualization Manager` combines physical servers and their memory and CPU power to create a single, large virtual machine.
It is the opposite of traditional server virtualization, which partitions a single physical system so that multiple OSes can be run on the hardware.
The technology is primarily used to run compute-intensive applications on a virtual symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system,
and can benefit users who want to provide very large memory and capacity resources for high-performance computing (HPC) needs 

## Getting started
`Aggregated Virtualization`, also known as `Virtualization for aggregation` or `resource aggregation`, 
is a technique that combines multiple physical servers and their resources (CPU, memory, storage) into a single,
logical resource pool that can be accessed and managed as a unified entity. This is essentially the opposite of
traditional server virtualization, which partitions a single physical machine into multiple virtual machines

## How it works:
- **Combining resources**:
  `AVM` as  `Aggregated Virtualization Manager` allows multiple physical servers to be treated as a single, larger server. 

- **Centralized management**:
  This unified view simplifies resource management and allocation, as administrators can manage the entire pool as one unit. 

- **Enhanced performance**:
  By pooling resources, `AVM` can improve performance and scalability for applications and workloads. 

- **Flexibility**:
  It allows for dynamic allocation of resources based on demand, improving resource utilization and reducing waste. 
- **Simplified infrastructure**:
  Reduces the number of physical servers needed, leading to lower hardware costs, power consumption, and management overhead. 

## Use cases

- **Microservices architecture**:
  `AVM` is crucial for modern microservices architectures,
  where many small, independent services need to be deployed and scaled efficiently. 

- **Cloud computing**:
  It's fundamental to cloud computing, enabling providers
  to offer scalable computing resources to users on demand. 

- **High-performance computing (HPC)**:
  `AVM` can create powerful virtual supercomputers by combining resources from multiple machines. 

## Key benefits

- **Increased resource utilization**:
  Resources are used more efficiently, reducing waste and cost. 

- **Improved scalability**:
  Easily scale resources up or down based on demand. 

- **Simplified management**:
  A single, unified view of resources simplifies administration.
  
- **Reduced costs**:
  Lower hardware, power, and management expenses. 

- **Faster deployment**:
  Quickly deploy and scale applications and services. 

In essence, `AVM` transforms a distributed collection of resources into a powerful,
unified resource pool, offering greater flexibility, efficiency, and scalability for modern computing needs.
